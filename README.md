# Voice-Chat
A simple voice chat feature using a third party sdk called AGORA Voice SDK

### Summary
This is a sample of the a project I've been doing for awhile to create voice channels for players similar to gather town. 
This is not much, but I have used SOLID principle in coding this feature. My apologies fore not completing the whole code. 
But you can use this as a reference in applying voice coms in your app. Adding spatial audio feature in this code can simply be done. 

### Setup
